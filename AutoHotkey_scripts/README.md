# Autohotkey scripts

Some of the functionality (mouse clicks) works with 1080p fullscreen - some windows might change place or size, need to be tested before use.

* `Construction.ahk` - for working with GiD and SAFIR
* `Diamond.ahk` - for easier working with diamond postprocessor (chart generation)
* `FindGidWindow.ahk` - two hotkeys (Ctrl+F11, Ctrl+F12) for returning the off-screen gid window back to the screen
* `TeXMaker.ahk` - hotstrings for working with texmaker
* `WindowsTerminal.ahk` - hotstrings for WT
* `area2lineload_automate.ahk` - automate generation of surfraces (IGES files) to be used with area2loadline.py script from kowalskiw/fireeng_tools repo
